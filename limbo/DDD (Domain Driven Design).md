  
DDD is an approach to break down the complexities of business rules, that will be modeled through a code base/architecture.

## Domain  

Area of knowledge or very specific and specialized activity around which the application logic revolves.

## The need for DDD  

To bridge the gap between business and code. By leveraging the use of Ubiquitous Language, Invariants and Objects of the domain.

## Parts of DDD  

Strategic Design / Tactical Design.

## Strategic Design (What/Why?) 

Visualize the whole picture of our Domain, being able to see the relationships between sub-domains.

## Tactical Design (How?) 

The way that a specific domain is composed and all the parts involved (code-side). Codebase that represents the Domain.

## Tactical Patterns 

Set of building blocks that allow us to model our Domain in a way that resembles the problem space.

### Noteworthy Patterns: 

- Modules 
- Application Services 
- Bounded Contexts 
- Ubiquitous Language


## Tactical Design vs Tactical Patterns 

With Tactical Design we model our Domain, and we build it through the tools that Tactical Patterns provides.

## (Tactical vs Strategic) Design 

Both are complementary in an iterative process of discovering business rules in the process and to model them. Both Tactical and Strategic Design compose DDD.
